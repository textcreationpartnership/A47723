            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE have received Your Majeſties Letters Dated from St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> the Sixth of <hi>February</hi> laſt, by the Earl of <hi>Carlingfort,</hi> Your Envoy in Our Court: By them We have underſtood the Condition Your Majeſty is reduced to; and that You being Deſerted, after the Landing of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by Your Army, and even by Your Domeſtick Servants, and thoſe You moſt Confided in, and almoſt by all Your Subjects: You have been forc'd by a ſudden Flight to provide for Your own ſafety, and to ſeek Shelter and Protection in <hi>France:</hi> And laſtly, That You deſire Aſſiſtance from Us for the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of Your Kingdoms. We do aſſure Your Majeſty, That as ſoon as We heard of this ſevere turn of Affairs, We were moved at it, not only with the common Senſe of Humanity, but with much deeper Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ſutable to the ſincere Affections which we have always bore to You: And We were truly ſorry that at laſt that was come to paſs which (though We hoped for better things, yet Our own ſad thoughts) had ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to us, would enſue.</p>
            <p>If Your Majeſty had rather given Credit to the friendly Remonſtrances that was made you by our late Envoy, the Count <hi>de Cannitz,</hi> in our Name, than to the deceitful Inſinuations of the <hi>French,</hi> whoſe chief aim was, by fomenting continual Diviſions, between you and your People, to gain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an opportunity to Inſult the more ſecurely over the reſt of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> and if Your Majeſty had put a ſtop, by your Force and Authority, to their many Infractions of the Peace, of which by the Treaty at <hi>Nimeguen</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:110341:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 25 -->you are made the Garand, and to that end hath entred into Conſultations with Us, and ſuch others as have the like juſt Sentiments in this matter, We are verily perſwaded, that by this means you ſhould have, in a great meaſure, quieted the minds of your people, which were ſo much exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated through univerſion to our Religion; and the publick Peace had been preſerv'd as well in your Kingdoms, as here in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But now we refer it even to Your Majeſty, to judge what condition we can be in, to afford you any aſſiſtance, we being not only engaged in a War with the <hi>Turk,</hi> but finds our ſelves at the ſame time Impertly and Barbarouſly attacked by the <hi>French,</hi> contrary to and againſt the Faith of Treaties, they reckoning themſelves ſecure of <hi>England.</hi> And this ought not to be conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the greateſt Injuries which have been done our Religion, have flowed from no others than the <hi>French</hi> themſelves, who not only eſteem it lawful for them to make perfidious Leagues, with the ſworn Enemies of the Holy Croſs, tending to the Deſtruction both of Us and the whole Chriſtian World, in order to the checking Our endeavours which were undertaken for the Glory of God, and to ſtop thoſe ſucceſſes which it hath pleaſed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to give us hitherto: But further, have heaped one Treachery on another, even in the Empire it ſelf. The Cities of the Empire which were ſurrendered upon Articles ſigned by the <hi>Dauphin</hi> himſelf, have been exhauſted by exceſſive Impoſitions, and after their being exhauſted have been plunder'd, and after plundering have been burnt and raz'd. The Palaces of Princes, which in all times, and even in the moſt Deſtructive Wars have been preſerved, are now burnt down to the Ground. The Churches are Robbed, and ſuch as ſubmitted themſelves to them, are in a moſt barbarous manner carried away Slaves; and in ſhort, it is become a diverſion to them to commit all manner of Inſolencies and Cruelties in many places, but chiefly in Catholick Countries, exceeding the Cruelties of the <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves; which having impoſed an abſolute neceſſity upon Us, to ſecure our ſelves and the Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, by the beſt means we can think on, and that no leſs againſt them than againſt the <hi>Turks:</hi> We promiſe our ſelves from your Juſtice, a ready aſſent to this, that it ought not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, if we endeavour to procure by a Juſt War, that ſecurity to our ſelves which we could not hitherto attain by ſo many Treaties; and that in order to the obtaining thereof, we take meaſures for our mutual defence and preſervation, with all thoſe who are equally concerned with us in the ſame deſign. It remains that we beg of God that he would direct all things to his Glory, and that he would grant Your Majeſty true and ſolid Comforts under this your great Calamity, We imbrace you with the tender affections of a Brorher. At <hi>Vienna,</hi> the 9th of <hi>April.</hi>
